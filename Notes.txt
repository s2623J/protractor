3 Types of Tests:
    1.  End to End Tests
            Tests entire application from a User point of view   
    2.  Integration Tests
            Tests integrations between parts
    3.  Unit Tests
            Tests smallest possible parts of code (ie. Inputs & Outputs)

Protractor:
    Technologies:
        Node
        Selenium
        WebDriver
        Jasmine
        Cucumber
        Mocha

    Avoids any "sleeps" or "waits" during testing
    Runs on "headless" browsers too 
    If running on Chrome, Protractor will not need to use Selenium
    Install with: "npm install -g protractor" and "webdriver-manager update"
    Install latest JDK
    Update the webdriver-manager: (ie."webdriver-manager update")
        webdriver-manager - runs the Selenium Server
        Run "webdriver-manager start" to start server on port 4444

Selenium:
        Congiguration file at: "C:\Users\[Username here]\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\protractor\example\conf.js"
        Test Server by opening prompt to above directory and entering: "protractor conf.js"
                It processes conf.js and tests example_spec.js

Jasmine:
    Follow example_spec.js as it demonstrates many feature implementations
    Add console outputs as each section is executed
    To temporarily disable a section function:
        ie. xit('should add a todo', function() {
    
Promises:
    3 Stages:
        Pending
        Fulfilled
        Rejected
    Example:
        (see image)
    
Page Object Model (POM):
    Creating a seperate module for each page tested (seperate from the actual testing page) 
        to provide importable/reusable code for the test page.
