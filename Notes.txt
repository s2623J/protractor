3 Types of Tests:
    1.  End to End Tests
            Tests entire application from a User point of view   
    2.  Integration Tests

Protractor:
    Technologies:
        Node
        Selenium
        WebDriver
        Jasmine
        Cucumber
        Mocha

    Avoids any "sleeps" or "waits" during testing
    Runs on "headless" browsers too 
    If running on Chrome, Protractor will not need to use Selenium
    Install with: "npm install -g protractor" and "webdriver-manager update"
    Install latest JDK
    Update the webdriver-manager: (ie."webdriver-manager update")
        webdriver-manager - runs the Selenium Server
        Run "webdriver-manager start" to start server on port 4444
        Launch a example page from: ""

Selenium:
        Congiguration file at: "C:\Users\[Username here]\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\protractor\example\conf.js"
        Test Server by opening prompt to above directory and entering: "protractor conf.js"
                It processes conf.js and tests example_spec.js
